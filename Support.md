CheckMeApp! Support Page - LMApplications

CheckMeApp! is currently an application which does not allow you to upload your own data and you must contact us to have your information inputted into the application. Information is retreived using a report from SIMS which I am able to provide you with. Other MIS systems have not yet been integrated.

The application is open to schools to enable them to reduce paper copies within the environment and therefore better complying with Data Protection and keeping data safe. 

No information is stored within the app and all is retrieved from the external server (details of which can be found in my privacy policy). 

If you would like to discuss how this would benefit your school please send an email to checkmeapps@gmail.com

Any queries or suggestions i would be happy to hear them. 

Thank you for your time and choosing CheckMeApp!
